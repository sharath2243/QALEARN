# 🧪 My Selenium + Python Automation Learning Journey

Welcome to my hands-on automation journey! This repository showcases my daily learning progress with **Selenium WebDriver using Python**, including writing automated test scripts, managing test data, and using testing frameworks like **Pytest**.

---

## 📅 Day-by-Day Progress

### 📘 Day 1: Introduction to Testing + First Selenium Script

**Manual Testing Theory Covered:**
- Test Cases vs Test Scenarios
- Types of Testing: Functional, Regression, Sanity, Smoke, UAT, Exploratory
- SDLC and STLC lifecycle understanding
- Bug Life Cycle and Defect Reporting

**Selenium Practice:**
- 🔗 Launched `python.org` using `driver.get()`
- 🔍 Performed a search using `By.NAME` and `send_keys()`
- ✅ Asserted page title with `assert`
- 🔁 Clicked buttons using `click()`
- 🦹 Closed browser using `driver.quit()`

---

### 🔐 Day 2: Login Flow Automation on SauceDemo

- Used `By.ID` to locate login fields
- Tested valid and invalid login scenarios
- Captured error messages for failures
- Handled exceptions using `try-except-finally`
- Implemented assertions for validating login success/failure

---

### 🧭 Day 3: XPath, Waits, and Reusable Functions

- ⏱ Replaced `time.sleep()` with `WebDriverWait` & `ExpectedConditions`
- Mastered XPath functions: `contains()`, `*`, and text-based search
- Created reusable functions like `perform_login()` and `check_error()`
- Introduced exception handling with `TimeoutException`
- Modularized test logic for clarity and reusability

---

### 📦 Day 4: Page Object Model (POM) & Test Structuring

- Implemented **Page Object Model (POM)** for scalable code
- Split code into:
  - `login_pom.py`: with methods like `load()`, `login()`, `get_error()`
  - `test_login.py`: for test cases using the POM class
- Used assertions to validate test outcomes
- Managed errors with `WebDriverException`, `TimeoutException`, and `AssertionError`
- Wrapped logic in `try-except-finally` for robust execution and browser cleanup

---

### 📂 Day 5: CSV-Driven Testing + Pytest Integration

- Read login test data from external `login_details.csv`
- Used `csv.DictReader()` for structured data handling
- Sanitized input with `.strip()` to avoid parsing issues
- Introduced **Pytest** framework for test automation
- Used `@pytest.mark.parametrize()` to feed test data dynamically from CSV
- Ran test cases directly using `pytest`

---
### 📂 Day 6 - Progress Summary

- Integrated `pytest.fixture` for WebDriver setup and teardown.
- Implemented **Product POM** with:
  - Single product add to cart 
  - Cart icon click
  - Basic error handling
- Combined Login + Product POM test (end-to-end)
- Added clean assertions for product add/cart
---
### 📅 Day 7 - Summary
- Read multiple product IDs from CSV and added them dynamically.
- Introduced time.sleep() delays for better step visibility.
- Added product title check (details page navigation + back button).
- Implemented single product removal from cart.
- No changes in login flow.
---
### 📅 Day 8 - Automation Progress
- Today, I extended my test automation framework by adding support for the checkout flow using a dedicated Page Object Model (POM) class. This class handles entering user details (First Name, Last Name, Zip Code) and continues the checkout process. I also refactored the product removal functionality to support multiple removals via CSV input, mirroring how products are added/removed.

- Additionally, I implemented robust error handling for all major test flows — including per-item screenshot capture in case of failure. This adds traceability and debugging ease to the test suite.
---
### 📅 Day 9 - Automation Progress
- Completed end-to-end checkout flow on SauceDemo using POM structure.
- Included cart cancel, checkout cancel, final order confirmation, and go-to-cart revisit.
- Added robust error handling, screenshots on failure, and assertions to verify dynamic user input.
- Used pytest to execute and validate flows with clear test separation.

- ___Backend (API Testing using requests + pytest):
- Introduced API automation with reqres.in, focusing on:
- POST login with various payloads and status expectations.
- GET single user and all users, with param checks.
- Used API key authentication via headers.
- Validated response structures, like token, data, and error.
- Wrote parameterized tests with meaningful assertions.

---
###  📅 Day 10 - Automation Progress
- POST /login: Tested valid, missing, and empty credentials
- GET /users/{id}: Fetched user info; handled 200 & 404 cases
- GET /users: Fetched all users and validated response
- DELETE /users/{id}: Verified auth-based behavior (with/without API key)
---
### 📅 Day 11 - Summary
- Created your own MockAPI project simulating a users and products resource. (It's free of cost for maximum 2 resource creation).
- Designed and tested the following HTTP methods:
    - Single product add to cart 
    - GET /users – Retrieve all users.
    - GET /users/:id – Retrieve a single user by ID.
    - POST /users – Create a new user.
    - DELETE /users/:id – Delete a specific user.
---
### 📅 Day 12 - Summary
- Migrated API testing script for `reqres.in` to a separate module
- Designed and tested a mock product API using CSV-driven testing
- Verified all test cases manually in Postman before automating
- Created and structured CSV test data with the following methods:
  - `GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`, `HEAD`.
---
### 📅 Day 13 to day 16 - Summary
- Experimented button's behaviour on `demoqa.com`.
- implemeted `@pytest.mark.smoke`, and it was unrecognisable then solved the issue by introduicng `pytest.ini`. (config file).
- Implemented **flaky test handling** using `@pytest.mark.flaky`.
- Resolved test instability caused by dynamic ads using:
  - Custom wait strategies
  - Retry logic via `pytest-rerunfailures`
- Installed and configured **Allure Reporting**:
  - Added Allure decorators:`@allure.title`, `@allure.severity`, `@allure.description`, etc,.
---
### 📅 Day 17 - Summary
- Implemeted **Allure reporting** on other test cases.
- Wrote root `pytest.ini` config.
- Generated `allure serve <filename>` reports.
- Had a look on what i wrote from the beginning.
